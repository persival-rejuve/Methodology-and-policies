This policy applies to all information owned, managed, controlled, or maintained by Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ Information covered in this policy includes, but is not limited to, information that is received, stored, processed, or transmitted via any means. This includes electronic, hardcopy, and any other form of information regardless of the media on which it resides.

### **Policy**

#### **Definitions**

- **Confidential/Restricted Data.** Generalized terms that typically represent data classified as _Sensitive or Private_, according to the data classification scheme defined in this policy
- **Internal Data**. All data owned or licensed by Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ.
- **Public Information.** Any information that is available within the public domain.

#### **Data Classification Scheme**

Data classification, in the context of information security, is the classification of data based on its level of sensitivity and the impact to Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ should that data be disclosed, altered, or destroyed without authorization. The classification of data helps determine what baseline security controls are appropriate for safeguarding that data. All data should be classified into one of the three following classifications.

#### **Confidential/Restricted Data**

Data should be classified as Restricted or Confidential when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could cause a serious or significant level of risk to Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ or its customers. Examples of sensitive data include data protected by state or federal privacy regulations (e.g. PHI & PII) and data protected by confidentiality agreements (refer to APPENDIX A ,that is applicable to GDPR and CCPA, for personal data categories related to privacy regulations). The highest level of security controls should be applied to Restricted and Confidential Data: 

- Disclosure or access to Restricted and Confidential data is limited to specific use by individuals with a legitimate need-to-know. Explicit authorization by the Security Officer is required for access to because of legal, contractual, privacy, or other constraints.
- Must be protected to prevent loss, theft, unauthorized access, and/or unauthorized disclosure.
- Must be destroyed when no longer needed. Destruction must be in accordance with Company policies and procedures.
- Will require specific methodologies, procedures, and reporting requirements for the response and handling of incidents.

#### **Internal Use Data**

Data should be classified as Internal Use when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of that data could result in a moderate level of risk to Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ or its customers. This includes proprietary, ethical, or privacy considerations. Data must be protected from unauthorized access, modification, transmission, storage or other use. This applies even though there may not be a civil statute requiring this protection. Internal Use Data is restricted to personnel who have a legitimate reason to access it. By default, all data that is not explicitly classified as Restricted/Confidential or Public data should be treated as Internal Use data. A reasonable level of security controls should be applied to Internal Use Data.

#### **Public Data**

Data should be classified as Public when the unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of that data would result in little or no risk to Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ and its customers. It is further defined as information with no existing local, national, or international legal restrictions on access or usage. While little or no controls are required to protect the confidentiality of Public data, some level of control is required to prevent unauthorized alteration or destruction of Public Data.

#### **De-identified Data**

Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ will de-identify data as a tool to remove personal information from data that it collects, uses, archives, and shares with other organizations. The de-identification process will allow the removal of direct identifiers, including all unique identifying numbers, characteristics, or codes. If a data set contains any amount or type of personal information, it will not be considered de-identified.

#### **Assessing Classification Level and Labeling**

The goal of information security, as stated in the Information Security Policy, is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Corporate and Customer Data. Data classification reflects the level of impact to Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ if confidentiality, integrity, or availability is compromised. 

If a classification is not inherently obvious, consider each security objective using the following table as a guide.  All data will be assigned one of the following four sensitivity levels.Re
