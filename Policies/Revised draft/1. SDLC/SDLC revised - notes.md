Based on the sources, the documents describe a **new, comprehensive 10-phase AI/ML lifecycle methodology (Phases 0-9)** that was developed. This methodology aims to provide a **repeatable, policy-compliant framework** for building, deploying, and retiring AI features within a mobile application backed by AWS infrastructure. It specifically **unifies** the ML/model workflow, the mobile app + AWS integration workflow, and the mandatory controls from the company's existing **SDLC Policy, Change-Management Policy, and Data-Classification Policy**.

The development of this new methodology was influenced by "real-world industry lessons" and designed to address specific pain points and strategic goals identified within the organization.

Here's how the new methodology represents changes or improvements compared to previous approaches or addresses specific issues, drawing heavily from the alignment check meeting minutes:

1. **Enforcing Policies & Closing Documentation Gaps:** The methodology makes policies mandatory starting with the **Phase 0 Charter and Security & Privacy Risk Assessment**. Every phase now has **named templates with sign-off columns** to ensure documentation is completed and approved. For example, the Feature/Service Design template (3.3) requires architecture diagrams to reside in the repository.
2. **AI Workflow Standardization:** The methodology provides a **full 10-phase template suite**. These templates standardize deliverables such as the **Feature Spec Sheet** (3.1), **Experiment Design & Log** (4.1), **Validation Checklist** (5.1), and **Model Card** (5.3), covering the entire AI workflow from design to validation.
3. **Stalled Workflows & Board Hygiene:** The methodology includes specific artifacts designed to prevent workflows from getting stuck and improve tracking. The **Change-Log** (8.2) and **Deployment Runbook** (6.2) with its "freeze flags" prevent states like hidden "UAT" limbo, while the **Post-Implementation Review (PIR)** (8.1) forces a review after a defined period (e.g., 30 days).
4. **Code Quality Discipline:** This is addressed by mandating the **Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist** (4.2) and incorporating a PR metrics table within the **Mobile Build & Unit-Test Report** (4.3), demanding evidence of quality and security checks before code merges.
5. **Knowledge Transfer:** The **Decommission Checklist** (9.1) includes tasks for handing over artifacts, and the **Change-Log** (8.2) captures shifts in ownership.
6. **QA Automation Urgency:** The methodology's templates, such as the **Integration Test Matrix** (5.2) and the **Mobile Build & Unit-Test Report** (4.3), explicitly **require automated test suites**. The **Incident Response Playbook** (7.2) also assumes alert-driven QA mechanisms.
7. **PR Reviews Including Validation Evidence:** The **Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist** (4.2) and **Validation Checklist** (5.1) are explicitly referenced in pull request descriptions, linking code changes directly to required security and validation checks.
8. **Leadership/Benchmarking & External Evaluation:** The methodology starts with a strong governance gate in Phase 0, requiring CEO and CTO sign-off on the Project Charter, setting the tone for external audits. The **Model Card** (5.3) serves as a transparency document suitable for stakeholders and auditors.

The methodology is **tool-agnostic**, as the templates are primarily in Markdown or Sheets formats, which addresses potential issues with tool redundancy.

Key aspects of the new methodology and its deliverables, which represent the "changes done based into the original document(s)" (referring to policies and previous practices) include:

- A clear **10-phase structure (0-9)**, with defined purposes, prerequisites, roles, technology focus, steps, gates, templates, and mandatory policy hooks for each phase.
- Integration of **SDLC, Change-Management, and Data-Classification policies** throughout all phases, ensuring controls like separation of duties, encryption, secure coding, risk assessment, and change approval are embedded from start to finish. For example, Phase 1's purpose is to secure data _and_ draft the API contract, incorporating security requirements early. Phase 3 ensures encryption, access roles, and change approvals are designed upfront. Phase 6 requires artifacts to be encrypted via KMS and the rollout plan to label Restricted vs Public endpoints. Phase 9 verifies Restricted data is deleted or archived per policy and exports are encrypted.
- A comprehensive suite of **45+ templates** covering every required artifact across the lifecycle, including:
    - Phase 0: Project Charter, Risk Assessment
    - Phase 1: Data Source Intake, Data Classification Register, API Contract, Ingestion Run Log
    - Phase 2: EDA Notebook Header, Data-Quality Checklist, UX Wireframes
    - Phase 3: Feature Spec Sheet, Transformation Pipeline Doc, Backend Service Design
    - Phase 4: Experiment Design & Log, Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist
    - Phase 5: Validation Checklist, Integration Test Matrix, Model Card
    - Phase 6: Change Request Packet, Deployment Runbook, Release & Rollback Plan
    - Phase 7: Monitoring Dashboard Spec, Incident Response Playbook, Mobile Telemetry Spec
    - Phase 8: Post-Implementation Review, Change-Log, Retraining Decision Log
    - Phase 9: Decommission Checklist, Data Deletion & Portability Record
- Specific **Gate Criteria for Phase Exit** for each phase, acting as mandatory checkpoints requiring specific deliverables and sign-offs before progressing.
- Explicit mapping of **Policy Hooks** for SDLC, Change-Management, and Data Classification within each phase description, serving as an internal audit checklist.
- Emphasis on **auditable trails** and **evidence generation** at every stage, from ingestion logs and code review logs to validation reports and production change logs, facilitating compliance and audits.

In essence, the new 10-phase methodology structures and formalizes the development process specifically for AI/ML features integrated into the Longevity App, ensuring that existing company-wide policies (SDLC, Change-Management, Data-Classification) and regulatory requirements (like GDPR/HIPAA referenced in the context of the broader SDLC) are **consistently applied and documented** throughout the entire lifecycle, from initial concept to retirement. It uses detailed templates and defined gates to provide a concrete, step-by-step playbook that addresses previously identified operational and compliance challenges.
