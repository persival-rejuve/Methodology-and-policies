### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Policy (Revised)

**Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ**

---

##### Purpose

This policy defines the high-level requirements for guiding the approval, planning, and lifecycle development of Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ software systems, specifically those involving **AI/ML models**, **mobile applications**, and **AWS infrastructure**. It establishes a **consistent, repeatable, and auditable 10-phase methodology** (Phases 0-9) that fully integrates Information Security requirements and aligns with Rejuve’s **Information Security Program**, **Change-Management Policy**, and **Data-Classification Policy** at every stage. It provides guidance for all project stakeholders, including program managers, technical leads, development teams, and data scientists.

##### Roles and Responsibilities

Ensuring compliance with this SDLC policy requires clear ownership and separation of duties. Key roles and their responsibilities within the phases include:

- **CTO**: Oversees SDLC compliance and ensures adherence to security practices. Provides **final approval** for the Project Charter (Phase 0 gate), Backend Service Design (Phase 3 gate), Deployment Runbook & Release Plan (Phase 6 policy coverage), Incident Reports (Phase 7 gate), Post-Implementation Reviews (Phase 8 gate), and System Retirement (Phase 9 gate).

Responsible for the Data-Quality Checklist (Phase 2), Mobile Build & Unit-Test Report (Phase 4), and the Validation Checklist & Integration Test Matrix (Phase 5). Provides **sign-off** on the Model Card (Phase 5) and Mobile Telemetry Spec (Phase 7).

##### Policy

Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ **must** establish and maintain processes for ensuring that its computer applications or systems follow an SDLC process which is consistent and repeatable, and maintains information security at every stage. This is achieved through the mandated use of the **10-phase AI/ML Lifecycle Methodology** (Phases 0-9). Each phase includes **mandatory templates** that serve as auditable artifacts and **explicit gate criteria** requiring specific approvals before progression to the next phase. This ensures that security and compliance requirements are **embedded** from initial concept through retirement.

The sequence of the development phases follows an **Agile + DevSecOps approach**. Iterative development cycles may involve repeating certain phases (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor) before a final major release. Progression between phases is **gated** by successful completion of required activities and sign-offs documented in the mandatory templates.

**Software Development Phases Standard** The **10-phase methodology** (Phases 0-9) replaces and provides detailed structure for the older generic SDLC phases (Determine System Need, Design, Build System Component, Evaluate System Readiness, System Deployment) tailored for AI/ML products. Progression through these phases is strictly governed by the **Gate / Approval** criteria.

- **Phase 0 – Governance & Determine System Need**: Define business need, set strategy, budget, risk appetite, and roles.
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Project Charter`, `RACI Matrix`, `Security & Privacy Risk Assessment`.
    - **Gate**: **CEO & CTO countersign Charter**; Security Officer approves initial risk rating.
- **Phase 1 – Data & API Definition**: Secure data sources, populate the central **`Data Classification Register`**, draft the mobile/backend API Contract (OpenAPI/GraphQL).
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Data Source Intake`, `Data Classification Register`, `DUA / IRB Consent Tracker`, `Ingestion Run Log`, `API Contract Stub` (YAML).
    - **Gate**: **Security Officer approves data labels & de-identification plan**; Product Manager approves API schema.
- **Phase 2 – Exploration & UX Wireframes**: Understand data quality/bias using EDA notebooks, prototype app wireframes showing model output, define consent language.
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `EDA Notebook Header`, `Data-Quality Checklist`, `UX Wireframe Pack Checklist`, `UX Wireframe PDF/Link`.
    - **Gate**: **Product Manager & Security Officer approve every Restricted screen** in the wireframe pack; All datasets score **≥ policy threshold** or have documented remediation.
- **Phase 3 – Feature / Service Design**: Transform data into production-ready features (`Feature Spec Sheet`), design the AWS backend architecture (`Backend Service Design`), document transformation pipelines (`Transformation Pipeline Doc`).
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Feature Spec Sheet`, `Transformation Pipeline Doc`, `Backend Service Design`.
    - **Gate**: **CTO + Security Officer approve Backend Service Design** (section 7 sign-off).
- **Phase 4 – Model & App Build**: Train models (`Experiment Design & Log`), build the mobile app (unit tests, static analysis), perform secure coding checks (`Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist`).
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Experiment Design & Log`, `Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist`, `Mobile Build & Unit-Test Report`.
    - **Gate**: Top-ranked model(s) meet performance & bias thresholds; **Security Officer & DevSecOps sign Secure-Coding Checklist**; Mobile Build passes scans, unit tests, and coverage threshold.
- **Phase 5 – Validation & Integration Test**: Independently validate the model (`Validation Checklist`, `Model Card`) and integrate end-to-end (mobile app + backend + model + data sources) (`Integration Test Matrix`).
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Validation Checklist`, `Integration Test Matrix`, `Model Card`.
    - **Gate**: **All validation tests green**; Model Card published with required approvals.
- **Phase 6 – Deployment & Release**: Deploy model and backend services, release mobile app with staged rollout, enforce full change-control process.
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Change Request Packet`, `Deployment Runbook`, `Release & Rollback Plan`.
    - **Gate**: **CCB approval logged** in `Change Request Packet`; Smoke tests green in prod; 30-day notice sent if infra change affects customers.
- **Phase 7 – Monitoring & Telemetry**: Implement dashboards, alerts, and incident response plans for system health, security, and model drift.
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Monitoring Dashboard`, `Incident Response Playbook`, `Mobile Telemetry Spec`.
    - **Gate**: **Monthly KPI & incident report signed by CTO + Security Officer**; Metrics + alerts operational.
- **Phase 8 – Continuous Improvement**: Analyze monitoring signals, conduct post-implementation reviews, manage retraining decisions and change logs.
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Post-Implementation Review (PIR) Form`, `Change-Log`, `Retraining Decision Log`.
    - **Gate**: PIR signed; New Change Requests entered & prioritized.
- **Phase 9 – Retirement / Portability**: Decommission system components, remove app from stores, fulfill data-portability and deletion requirements.
    - **Mandatory Templates**: `Data Deletion & Portability Record`, `Decommission Checklist`.
    - **Gate**: **CTO & Security Officer confirm archival + deletion**; Customer acknowledgements stored.

**Project Management** The recommended approach for navigating these phases is **Agile Development** (e.g., Scrum) combined with **DevSecOps** practices. This iterative approach allows for flexibility while embedding security and operational rigor throughout the lifecycle. The phases provide a structural framework, and Agile/DevSecOps provides the workflow and automation within that structure.

**SDLC Security Control Guidelines** The core security control guidelines established in the Information Security Program are implemented and verified throughout the 10-phase methodology via specific activities, mandatory templates, and gate requirements:

- Adequate procedures for **separation of duties**: This is enforced through the defined **Roles and Responsibilities** and required **sign-offs** on mandatory templates by different parties (e.g., Security Officer and Product Manager approving wireframes, CTO and Security Officer approving the Backend Service Design, independent QA performing validation). Separation between development/test and production environments is managed via **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and access controls.
- **Modification of code or emergency release** follows the **change control standard**: All changes to production are governed by **Phase 6 (Deployment & Release)**, requiring a **`Change Request Packet`**, **CCB approval**, a **`Deployment Runbook`**, and a **`Release & Rollback Plan`**. The **`Change-Log`** (Phase 8) provides the audit trail for all production changes. Human approval for production changes is mandated.
- **Secure programming standards** and training: These are emphasized in **Phase 4 (Model & App Build)**. Adherence is enforced by the mandatory **`Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist`**, which is signed off by the Security Officer and DevSecOps. Code changes require **pull request code reviews** by individuals knowledgeable in secure coding. Training is a necessary supporting activity.
- **Threat modeling, incident reviews, vulnerability thresholds, contingency planning**: **Threat modeling** is a key activity during the Design Phase and its outputs are tracked, leading to mitigations verified in the **`Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist`** (Phase 4). **Incident reviews** are formalized in **Phase 7 (Monitoring & Telemetry)** via the **`Incident Response Playbook`** and in **Phase 8 (Continuous Improvement)** via the **`Post-Implementation Review`**, which includes incident summaries. **Vulnerability thresholds** are part of the Phase 4 build gates (e.g., static scans). **Contingency planning** (backup, disaster recovery) is documented as part of the Deployment & Release phase deliverables (e.g., in the **`Deployment Runbook`** or separate plan).
- Preventing security issues (SANS, OWASP): OWASP guidelines are explicitly referenced in the **`Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist`** (Phase 4) and verified during **Phase 5 Validation** via automated scans (DAST/SAST) and potentially penetration testing.
- **Code changes reviewed** by knowledgeable individuals: This is a standard practice in the Development Phase enforced by mandatory **Pull Request (PR) code reviews**. Phase 4 requires tracking this via the `Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist` linked to PRs.
- Overrides/Authorizations: While not a specific template, the structure of mandatory approvals and sign-offs by authorized owners (e.g., CCB approval in Phase 6) ensures appropriate authorization for critical actions.
- **Separation of application development activity from production and test environments**: This is a core tenet of the DevSecOps approach, enabled by CI/CD pipelines and managing environments using **IaC**. The extent of logical/physical separation is determined based on the risk rating established in Phase 0 and documented in the Backend Service Design (Phase 3).
- Changes to production environments strictly follow **change control procedures, including human approval**: This is the explicit gate for **Phase 6 (Deployment & Release)**, requiring **CCB approval** of the `Change Request Packet` before execution. Automated updates are part of the process but require this initial human approval.

By mandating the use of the 10-phase methodology and requiring the completion and approval of the specified core templates at each phase gate, this policy ensures that the Longevity App and all subsequent AI/ML systems and mobile applications developed by Rejuve Tech L.L.C-FZ are built, deployed, and maintained in a **secure, compliant, repeatable, and auditable** manner.
