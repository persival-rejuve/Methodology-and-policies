# Unified AI/ML & App Development Lifecycle Methodology

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for Rejuve's Unified AI/ML & App Development Lifecycle Methodology, which integrates traditional software development with AI/ML workflows into a coherent, compliance-oriented process framework.

The methodology consists of 10 phases (0-9) that guide teams from initial project conception through deployment to eventual retirement, while maintaining alignment with SDLC, Change-Management, and Data-Classification policies.

## Document Structure

This folder is organized into the following documents:

### Core Methodology Documents

- **[Unified Lifecycle.md](./Unified%20Lifecycle.md)** - Condensed summary of the entire methodology with phase descriptions and deliverables
- **[Unified Lifecycle Overview.md](./Unified%20Lifecycle%20Overview.md)** - Narrative introduction to the methodology's philosophy and approach

### Detailed Phase Documentation

Each phase is thoroughly documented in its own file with consistent sections covering purpose, activities, roles, deliverables, and compliance considerations:

1. **[Phase_0_Governance.md](./Phase_0_Governance.md)** - Establishing business objectives, risk parameters, and governance structure
2. **[Phase_1_Data_API_Definition.md](./Phase_1_Data_API_Definition.md)** - Securing data sources and defining API contracts
3. **[Phase_2_Exploration_UX.md](./Phase_2_Exploration_UX.md)** - Exploratory data analysis and UX wireframe design
4. **[Phase_3_Feature_Service_Design.md](./Phase_3_Feature_Service_Design.md)** - Feature specification and technical architecture design
5. **[Phase_4_Model_App_Build.md](./Phase_4_Model_App_Build.md)** - Model training and application development
6. **[Phase_5_Validation_Integration.md](./Phase_5_Validation_Integration.md)** - System validation and integration testing
7. **[Phase_6_Deployment_Release.md](./Phase_6_Deployment_Release.md)** - Controlled deployment and release management
8. **[Phase_7_Monitoring_Telemetry.md](./Phase_7_Monitoring_Telemetry.md)** - Operational monitoring and telemetry
9. **[Phase_8_Continuous_Improvement.md](./Phase_8_Continuous_Improvement.md)** - Ongoing enhancement and evolution
10. **[Phase_9_Retirement_Archival.md](./Phase_9_Retirement_Archival.md)** - System decommissioning and knowledge preservation

## How to Use This Methodology

### For Project Managers

1. Start with the **Unified Lifecycle Overview** to understand the methodology's principles
2. Reference the condensed **Unified Lifecycle** document for a quick summary of phases and deliverables
3. For each project phase, consult the detailed phase document for comprehensive guidance

### For Team Members

1. Reference your current phase's detailed document to understand specific activities and deliverables
2. Use the workflow diagrams in each phase document to visualize the process flow
3. Consult the roles and responsibilities sections to clarify ownership and participation expectations

### For Compliance and Governance Teams

1. Each phase document includes specific compliance hooks for SDLC, Change Management, and Data Classification
2. Entry and exit criteria provide clear governance checkpoints
3. Best practices and common pitfalls sections highlight compliance considerations
