# Rejuve Methodology and Policies Repository

## Overview

This repository contains Rejuve's comprehensive methodologies and policies for software development, AI/ML implementation, and governance frameworks. It serves as the central knowledge base for all organizational processes, ensuring consistent, compliant, and efficient development across all projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

### 1. AI Methodology Lifecycle

A complete, phase-by-phase methodology that unifies ML/model workflows with mobile-app and AWS integration workflows while maintaining compliance with organizational policies.

- **[README](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/README/)**: Core methodology documentation
  - [Methodology Complete](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/README/Methodology%20Complete.md) - Comprehensive methodology documentation
  - [Executive Summary](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/README/AI-ML%20Lifecycle%20Executive%20Methodology%20Summary.md) - Condensed overview for leadership
  - [Assessment and Plan](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/README/Assessment%20and%20plan.md) - Implementation planning
  - [Alignment Check](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/README/Alignment%20Check%20meeting%20as%20of%20May%2C%2016th.md) - Synchronization with organizational goals

- **[Templates](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/Templates/)**: Standardized documents for each phase
  - Phase 0-9 templates covering the entire project lifecycle
  - Numbered and organized for easy reference (e.g., 1.1 Project Charter)

### 2. Unified Methodology

An integrated approach combining traditional software development with AI/ML workflows in a coherent, compliance-oriented framework.

- [Unified Lifecycle](/Unified%20Methodology/Unified%20Lifecycle.md) - Condensed summary
- [Detailed Phase Documentation](/Unified%20Methodology/) - Comprehensive guides for each phase
- [Checklist](/Unified%20Methodology/Checklist.md) - Implementation tracking with template references

### 3. Policies

Core organizational policies that govern all development and operational activities.

- [Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)](/Policies/Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle%20(SDLC).md)
- [Change Management](/Policies/Change%20Management.md)
- [Data Classification](/Policies/Data%20Classification.md)
- [Templates and Deliverables](/Policies/Templates%20and%20deliverables.md)

### 4. SDLC Methodology

Additional methodological frameworks and best practices for software development.

- [Agile + DevSecOps](/SLDC%20Methodology/Agile%20+%20DevSecOps%20software%20development%20life%20cycle.md)
- [Unit Testing Best Practices](/SLDC%20Methodology/Unit%20Tests%20best%20practices.md)

## Methodology Phases

The AI/ML & App Development Lifecycle Methodology consists of 10 phases (0-9):

0. **Governance & Determine System Need** - Establish business objectives and governance structure
1. **Data & API Definition** - Secure data sources and define API contracts
2. **Exploration & UX Wireframes** - Conduct data analysis and design user experiences
3. **Feature / Service Design** - Create detailed specifications and architecture
4. **Model & App Build** - Develop models and application components
5. **Validation & Integration Test** - Verify functionality and integration
6. **Deployment & Release** - Safely deploy to production environments
7. **Monitoring & Telemetry** - Establish observability and incident response
8. **Continuous Improvement** - Evolve based on feedback and performance
9. **Retirement & Archival** - Safely decommission systems and preserve knowledge

## Key Features

- **Policy Integration** - Compliance requirements embedded within each phase
- **Consistent Structure** - Standardized documentation across all phases
- **Visual Workflows** - Mermaid diagrams illustrating process flows
- **Clear Deliverables** - Specific templates for each phase
- **Role Clarity** - Defined responsibilities and participation expectations

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the [Executive Summary](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/README/AI-ML%20Lifecycle%20Executive%20Methodology%20Summary.md) for a high-level overview
2. Review the [Methodology Complete](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/README/Methodology%20Complete.md) document for detailed explanations
3. Use the [Checklist](/Unified%20Methodology/Checklist.md) to track implementation progress
4. Reference [Templates](/AI%20Methodology%20Lifecycle/Templates/) for required deliverables

## Usage Guidelines

### For Project Managers
- Use the methodology to structure project phases
- Reference templates for required documentation
- Track progress using the checklists

### For Development Teams
- Review role responsibilities for each phase
- Use templates to standardize deliverables
- Follow embedded compliance requirements

### For Compliance and Governance
- Reference policy hooks in each phase
- Use gate criteria for approval checkpoints
- Validate deliverables against standards

## Maintenance

This repository is maintained as a living document and updated based on implementation feedback and evolving best practices. Please direct any questions or suggestions for improvement to the methodology maintenance team.
