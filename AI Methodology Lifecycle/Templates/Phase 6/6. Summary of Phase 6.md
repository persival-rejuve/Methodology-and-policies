# Executive Summary – Phase 6: Deployment & Release

---

## Objective

Safely deploy the validated model, backend services, and mobile application to production while ensuring rollback readiness, stakeholder communication, and policy compliance.

---

## Why it Matters

- **User Impact** – This phase makes the AI product publicly available; missteps directly affect customers.
    
- **Risk Control** – Pre‑approved Change Request, detailed Runbook, and staged Release Plan minimize downtime and security incidents.
    
- **Audit Readiness** – Complete evidence trail (CR Packet + Runbook + Release Plan) satisfies SDLC, Change‑Mgmt, and Data‑Classification mandates.

## Key Milestones

1. **Change Request Packet (6.1)** approved by the CCB.
    
2. **Deployment Runbook (6.2)** executed without errors; post‑deploy validation KPIs met.
    
3. **Release & Rollback Plan (6.3)** completed: staged rollout to 100 % of users; no rollback triggered.

## Policy Coverage

|Policy|Evidence in Phase 6|
|---|---|
|**SDLC – System Deployment**|Deployment Runbook & Release Plan reviewed by CTO + Security.|
|**Change‑Mgmt**|CR Packet logged in Jira (`CR-2025-06-01`); CCB signatures stored.|
|**Data Classification**|Artefacts encrypted via KMS; rollout plan labels Restricted vs Public endpoints.|

## Outputs / Templates Completed

1. **6.1 Change Request Packet** – scope, ROI, risks, CCB approvals.
    
2. **6.2 Deployment Runbook** – step‑by‑step commands, validation checks, rollback cmds.
    
3. **6.3 Release & Rollback Plan** – staged rollout percentages, success metrics, comms timeline.
    

---

## Gate Criteria for Phase Exit

- ✔ CCB approves Change Request Packet.
    
- ✔ Runbook executed; post‑deploy validation shows API 5xx < 1 %, latency p95 ≤ 2.5 s, crash‑free ≥ 99.5 %.
    
- ✔ Release Plan reached 100 % rollout; no critical alerts triggered.
    
- ✔ Post‑release review logged; lessons learned & action items captured.

## Next Step

Enter **Phase 7 – Monitoring & Telemetry**, where we:

- Set up CloudWatch dashboards, Grafana, Pinpoint, and Sentry alerts.
    
- Define drift detection, bias monitoring, and incident‑response playbooks.
    

**Templates to deliver next:**

- **7.1 Monitoring Dashboard Spec**
    
- **7.2 Incident Response Playbook**
    
- **7.3 Mobile Telemetry Spec**
