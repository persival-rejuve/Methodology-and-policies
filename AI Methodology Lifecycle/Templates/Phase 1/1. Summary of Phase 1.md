## Executive Summary – Phase 1: Data & API Definition

**Objective:** Secure, classify, and legalize all incoming data and publish the first API contract that the mobile app and AWS backend will use to call the model.

**Why it matters:**

*   Prevents “shadow data” and legal gaps early.
*   Gives backend & mobile teams an unambiguous contract.
*   Establishes encryption, access-control, and separation-of-duties rules that ripple through every later phase.

**Key Milestones:**

1.  Data sources approved (DUA/IRB signed).
2.  Classification Register complete and Security Officer–approved.
3.  API Contract v0.1 published in SwaggerHub / repo.
4.  First ingestion run logged and verified (encryption, checksums, SoD).

**Primary Roles:**

*   Product Manager (business scope)
*   Security Officer (classification & legal)
*   Data Steward / Data Scientist (technical intake)
*   Backend API Engineer (OpenAPI author)
*   Project Manager (artifact traceability)

**Policy Coverage:**

*   **SDLC:** “Define System Requirements” & security hooks captured in API spec.
*   **Change-Mgmt:** Jira IDs on every ingestion & spec change; CCB packet queued for later deploy.
*   **Data Classification:** Register + Legend tab provide auditable mapping, encryption rules, NDA rules, retention clocks.

**Outputs / Templates Completed:**

1.  1.2 Project Charter (done in Phase 0 – reference)
2.  1.3 Data Source Intake – one row per dataset.
3.  1.  3 Data Classification Register – master sheet.
    *   Legend tab – quick policy lookup.
4.  1.  4 DUA / IRB Consent Tracker – legal status monitor.
5.  1.  5 Ingestion Run Log – operational evidence for each load.
6.  1.  6 API Contract Stub – OpenAPI 3 YAML (secured with Cognito).

**Gate Criteria for Phase Exit:**

*   ✔ Security Officer sign-off on Classification Register.
*   ✔ All datasets have “Approved” status in DUA/IRB tracker.
*   ✔ API Contract v0.1 merged to main and linked in Jira.
*   ✔ At least one successful ingestion run logged, with SoD & encryption verified.

### **Next Step:** 
Phase 2 – Exploration & UX Wireframes, where we profile the classified data and design the first mobile screens.
