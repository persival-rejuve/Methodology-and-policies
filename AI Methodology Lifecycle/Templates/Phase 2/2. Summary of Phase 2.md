## Executive Summary – **Phase 2: Exploration & UX Wireframes**

---

### **Objective**

_Profile and validate the quality, bias, and security posture of every classified dataset and design the first set of mobile-app wireframes that will surface model outputs to users._

---

### **Why it matters**

- **Data confidence.** Prevents bad features and model drift later by catching duplicates, outliers, and hidden bias early.
    
- **Design alignment.** Gives engineering a visual contract that maps each API call to on-screen elements and analytics events.
    
- **Privacy-by-design.** Ensures Restricted data never leaves controlled notebooks and that every screen includes the correct consent, encryption, and telemetry tags.
    

---

### **Key Milestones**

1. **EDA notebooks created** with compliance banner (Secure-Handling Checklist ticked).
    
2. **Data-Quality Checklist** completed for every dataset; scores ≥ policy threshold or remediation plan logged.
    
3. **UX Wireframe Pack** (Figma) approved by Product and Security, with API endpoints & analytics events mapped.
    

---

### **Primary Roles**

- **Data Scientist / Analyst** – run EDA, score data quality, flag bias.
    
- **UX Designer** – produce wireframes & consent flows.
    
- **Product Manager** – validate user stories & acceptance criteria.
    
- **Security Officer** – verify Restricted data never exported; approve privacy wording.
    
- **Project Manager** – track artefacts, link to Jira, enforce exit gates.
    

---

### **Policy Coverage**

- **SDLC:** “Design System Components” – data constraints, UI consent, and error states documented.
    
- **Data Classification:** EDA banner + Checklist inherit levels from Register; Restricted data protected (TLS, no local export).
    
- **Change-Mgmt:** Every notebook & wireframe linked to discovery tickets; design revisions require PR + reviewer sign-off.

### **Outputs / Templates Completed**

1. **2.1 EDA Notebook Header** – compliance banner in every analysis notebook.
    
2. **2.2 Data-Quality Checklist** – Google-Sheets table scoring completeness, duplicates, outliers, bias.
    
3. **2.3 UX Wireframe Pack Checklist** – sheet mapping each screen → API endpoint, data classification, consent status, analytics tags.
    

---

### **Gate Criteria for Phase Exit**

✔ All datasets score **≥ threshold** _or_ have documented remediation actions.  
✔ Security Officer signs each EDA notebook that handles **Restricted** data.  
✔ Product Manager & Security Officer approve every **Restricted** screen in the wireframe pack.  
✔ Jira epics updated with links to approved wireframes and data-quality results.

### **Next Step**

Begin **Phase 3 – Feature / Service Design**, where we:

- Finalize feature engineering specs (inheriting classification tags).
- Design AWS backend services (Lambda/ECS, AppSync, Cognito).
- Produce Transformation Pipeline Doc and Backend Service Design templates.

(Templates to deliver: **3.1 Feature Spec Sheet**, **3.2 Transformation Pipeline Doc**, **3.3 Backend Service Design**.)
