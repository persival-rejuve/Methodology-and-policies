# Executive Summary – Phase 9: Retirement & Archival

---

## Objective

Shut down the AI product safely, fulfill all customer data‑portability and deletion obligations, archive artefacts for audit, and close out operational infrastructure—leaving a compliant, verifiable trail.

---

## Why it Matters

- **Regulatory Compliance** – GDPR/CCPA portability and HIPAA data‑deletion rules demand airtight evidence.
    
- **Cost & Risk Reduction** – Decommissioning unused infrastructure eliminates attack surface and cloud spend.
    
- **Audit Readiness** – Final artefact archive and signed records ensure future audits can trace the full ML lifecycle.
    

---

## Key Milestones

1. **Decommission Checklist (9.1)** completed: customer notifications, data exports, infrastructure teardown tasks checked off.
    
2. **Data Deletion & Portability Record (9.2)** issued for each user: exports delivered, deletions verified, approvals signed.
    
3. Infrastructure stacks destroyed; S3 Glacier archives configured with 7‑year retention.
