# Executive Summary – Phase 5: Validation & Integration Test

---

## Objective

Validate that the trained model **AND** its end‑to‑end integration with the mobile app meet performance, fairness, privacy, and functional requirements before production deployment.

---

## Why it Matters

- **Risk Reduction** – Independent QA catches performance regressions, bias, and privacy leaks before they impact users.
    
- **Regulatory Compliance** – Evidence satisfies HIPAA/GDPR, SDLC, Change‑Mgmt, and Data‑Classification policies.
    
- **Production Readiness** – Successful E2E tests prove the mobile→API→model round‑trip under real latency conditions.
    

---

## Key Milestones

1. **Validation Checklist (5.1)** approved – all performance, fairness, privacy, robustness tests pass.
    
2. **Integration Test Matrix (5.2)** executed – critical user flows 100 % pass, API latency p95 < 2.5 s.
    
3. **Model Card (5.3)** published – documents intended use, metrics, limitations, monitoring plan.

## Primary Roles

|Role|Responsibility|
|---|---|
|QA/Test Lead|Run validation & E2E suites, compile evidence|
|Security Officer|Review privacy, security, bias results; sign Model Card|
|Product Manager|Confirm user‑story coverage & consent flows|
|DevSecOps|Ensure test environments mirror prod; collect logs|
|Clinical Reviewer (opt.)|Sanity‑check insights & explanations|

---

## Policy Coverage

|Policy|Evidence in Phase 5|
|---|---|
|**SDLC – Evaluate System Readiness**|5.1 checklist + 5.2 matrix prove independent testing|
|**Change‑Mgmt**|Jira ticket links to validation run IDs; CCB packet prepared for Phase 6|
|**Data Classification**|Restricted data de‑identified in logs; telemetry events tagged in Integration Matrix|

---

## Outputs / Templates Completed

1. **5.1 Validation Checklist** – performance, fairness, privacy, robustness, sign‑offs.
    
2. **5.2 Integration Test Matrix** – user‑story ↔ API ↔ assertion table + pass‑rate summary.
    
3. **5.3 Model Card** – comprehensive factsheet for auditors & stakeholders.
    

---

## Gate Criteria for Phase Exit

- ✔ **Overall Status = Approved** in Validation Checklist; no blocking issues.
    
- ✔ Integration Test pass‑rate ≥ 95 %, latency & crash‑free KPIs meet thresholds.
    
- ✔ Model Card signed by QA, Security, Product (and Clinical if required).

## Next Step

Move to **Phase 6 – Deployment & Release**, where we:

- Assemble **Change Request Packet** for CCB approval.
    
- Deploy model & backend via IaC pipeline with canary rollout.
    
- Release mobile app through staged rollout.
    

**Templates to deliver next:**

- **6.1 Change Request Packet**
    
- **6.2 Deployment Runbook**
    
- **6.3 Release & Rollback Plan**
