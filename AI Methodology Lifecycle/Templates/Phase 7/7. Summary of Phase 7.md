# Executive Summary – Phase 7: Monitoring & Telemetry

---

## Objective

Establish real-time visibility, alerting, and incident‑response capabilities for the AI model, backend services, and mobile app—ensuring performance, security, and bias KPIs remain within defined thresholds post‑launch.

---

## Why it Matters

- **Proactive Detection** – Dashboards and alerts let the team catch issues (latency, crash spikes, bias drift) before they affect users.
    
- **Regulatory Assurance** – Continuous monitoring of Restricted data flows and bias metrics upholds HIPAA/GDPR and ethical AI commitments.
    
- **Operational Readiness** – A tested incident playbook shortens mean‑time‑to‑resolve and documents actions for audits.

## Key Milestones

1. **Monitoring Dashboard Spec (7.1)** deployed in CloudWatch + Grafana with live metrics and thresholds.
    
2. **Incident Response Playbook (7.2)** approved by Security, with Severity Matrix and communication plan integrated into PagerDuty.
    
3. **Mobile Telemetry Spec (7.3)** implemented: events tagged, consent modal live, S3 lifecycle rules active.

## Primary Roles

|Role|Responsibility|
|---|---|
|**DevSecOps Lead**|Configure dashboards, alerts, and retention policies.|
|**Security Officer**|Approve data‑classification tags, verify encryption and consent flows.|
|**Mobile QA Lead**|Validate telemetry events and crash‑free KPI accuracy.|
|**Product Manager**|Monitor user impact metrics; coordinate incident comms.|
|**Incident Commander (on‑call)**|Execute playbook during SEV‑1/2 incidents.|

---

## Policy Coverage

|Policy|Evidence in Phase 7|
|---|---|
|**SDLC – Operations & Maintenance**|Dashboards + playbook document ongoing operational controls.|
|**Change‑Mgmt**|All dashboard metric & alert changes tracked via IaC + PR reviews.|
|**Data Classification**|Telemetry events classified; Restricted events encrypted and follow retention rules.|

---

## Outputs / Templates Completed

1. **7.1 Monitoring Dashboard Spec** – metric inventory, thresholds, alert routing.
    
2. **7.2 Incident Response Playbook** – severity levels, mitigation steps, comms plan.
    
3. **7.3 Mobile Telemetry Spec** – event dictionary, data‑flow diagram, privacy controls.
    

---

## Gate Criteria for Phase Exit

- ✔ All critical metrics & alerts live in production dashboards.
    
- ✔ Incident on‑call rotation defined; playbook tested in simulated SEV‑2 drill.
    
- ✔ Telemetry events validated end‑to‑end; consent modal approved by Security.

## Next Step

Proceed to **Phase 8 – Continuous Improvement**, where we:

- Conduct post‑implementation reviews (PIR) for first month of production.
    
- Schedule retraining or code iterations based on monitoring signals.
    

**Templates to deliver:**

- **8.1 Post‑Implementation Review (PIR) Form**
    
- **8.2 Change‑Log**
    
- **8.3 Retraining Decision Log**
