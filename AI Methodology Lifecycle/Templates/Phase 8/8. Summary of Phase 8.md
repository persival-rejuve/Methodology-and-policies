# Executive Summary – Phase 8: Continuous Improvement

---

## Objective

Leverage monitoring insights to iteratively improve the model, mobile app, and backend—while maintaining a rigorous audit trail for every decision, change, and retraining cycle.

---

## Why it Matters

- **Sustained Performance** – Addresses drift, bias, and performance decay before they impact users.
    
- **Governance** – Post‑implementation reviews and change logs fulfil SDLC & Change‑Mgmt controls.
    
- **Transparency** – Retraining log clearly documents why and when the model evolves, easing regulatory audits and stakeholder trust.

## Key Milestones

1. **Post‑Implementation Review (8.1)** completed for first 30‑day window; action items assigned.
    
2. **Change‑Log (8.2)** automated; every prod change linked to CR, PIR, or incident.
    
3. **Retraining Decision Log (8.3)** operational; first bias‑breach decision logged.

## Policy Coverage

|Policy|Phase‑8 Evidence|
|---|---|
|**SDLC – Continuous Improvement**|PIR forms & retrain decisions show iterative cycle.|
|**Change‑Mgmt**|Change‑Log provides single ledger; approvals captured.|
|**Data Classification**|New data/features routed through Phase‑1 intake before use.|

## Outputs / Templates Completed

1. **8.1 Post‑Implementation Review (PIR) Form** – KPI outcomes, incidents, lessons, action items.
    
2. **8.2 Change‑Log** – Automated ledger of prod changes.
    
3. **8.3 Retraining Decision Log** – Metrics‑triggered retraining decisions with approvals.
    

---

## Gate Criteria for Phase Exit

- ✔ Open action items < 20 % overdue.
    
- ✔ Change‑Log up‑to‑date; monthly audit export verified.
    
- ✔ Retraining decisions logged for each monitoring cycle.

## Next Step

Move to **Phase 9 – Retirement & Archival**, where we:

- Execute decommission checklist when model/app reach EOL.
    
- Provide data portability exports to customers.
    
- Archive artefacts for audit compliance.
    

**Templates to deliver:**

- **9.1 Decommission Checklist**
    
- **9.2 Data Deletion & Portability Record**
