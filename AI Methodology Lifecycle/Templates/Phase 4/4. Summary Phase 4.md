## Executive Summary – **Phase 4: Modeling & App Build**

---

### **Objective**

Train and track reproducible model experiments **and** build hardened mobile app binaries—each passing secure-coding, threat-model, and test-coverage gates—so both artefacts are ready for Phase 5 validation.

---

### **Why it matters**

- **Reproducibility.** The Experiment Log guarantees every metric, hyper-param, and dataset version is traceable to a commit and ticket.
    
- **Security by default.** The unified Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist blocks high-severity vulns and forces STRIDE thinking before code reaches main.
    
- **Quality & store readiness.** Mobile Build Report enforces unit-test coverage, static scans, permission vetting, and privacy-label compliance—avoiding last-minute App Store / Play rejections.
    

---

### **Key Milestones**

1. **Experiment Design & Log** populated for all candidate models; top-N meet metric and fairness thresholds.
    
2. **Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist** completed and signed by Security, DevSecOps, QA, Product.
    
3. **Mobile Build & Unit-Test Report** shows 0 high-severity findings, ≥ coverage threshold, and passes device-farm smoke tests.

### **Primary Roles**

- **Data Scientist / ML Engineer** – own Experiment Log, metric targets.
    
- **Mobile Dev Lead** – compile binaries, resolve static-analysis issues.
    
- **DevSecOps** – run CI pipelines, enforce SBOM & supply-chain signing.
    
- **Security Officer** – approve checklist, verify OWASP & privacy strings.
    
- **QA/Test Lead** – validate unit-tests, device-farm suites.
    
- **Project Manager** – tie artefacts to Jira tickets, schedule sign-offs.

### **Policy Coverage**

|Policy|Phase-4 Evidence|
|---|---|
|**SDLC – Build System Components**|Experiment Log + Mobile Build Report prove code reviews, unit-tests, and vulnerability scans.|
|**Change-Mgmt**|Each model run & mobile build linked to Jira/PR; checklist sign-offs required before merge; CCB packet queued for Phase 6 deploy.|
|**Data Classification**|Secure-Handling section in Experiment Log ensures Restricted data never logged; Mobile permissions table tags telemetry with data-class level.|

---

### **Outputs / Templates Completed**

1. **4.1 Experiment Design & Log** – one row per model run, incl. fairness metrics & encryption checklist.
    
2. **4.2 Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist** – static scans, SBOM, OWASP mitigations, DFD/STRIDE table, runtime controls, sign-offs.
    
3. **4.3 Mobile Build & Unit-Test Report** – static+dependency scans, unit-test coverage, permissions review, store-compliance checks.
    

---

### **Gate Criteria for Phase Exit**

- ✔ Top-ranked model(s) meet performance & bias thresholds; artefacts encrypted and stored.
    
- ✔ Security Officer & DevSecOps sign **4.2**; no high-severity vulns or unresolved STRIDE threats.
    
- ✔ Mobile Build passes static scans, 100 % unit-test pass, coverage ≥ threshold, privacy strings verified.
    
- ✔ All three templates attached to respective Jira epics with **Approved** status.

### **Next Step**

**Phase 5 – Validation & Integration Test**, where:

- Independent QA validates model performance, bias, privacy, and clinical relevance.
    
- Automated end-to-end tests confirm the mobile app ↔ API ↔ model round-trip.
    
- Model Card is generated for production release.
    

**Templates to deliver:**

1. **5.1 Validation Checklist** (performance, bias, privacy).
    
2. **5.2 Integration Test Matrix** (Postman + Appium).
    
3. **5.3 Model Card** (factsheet for audit & store).
