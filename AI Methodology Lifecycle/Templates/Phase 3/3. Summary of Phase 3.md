## Executive Summary – **Phase 3: Feature & Service Design**

---

### **Objective**

Transform raw, classified data into production-ready **features** and design the complete **AWS backend architecture** (API Gateway → Lambda/Fargate → Model Container, Cognito, observability) that will power the mobile app and model in production.

---

### **Why it matters**

- **Feature robustness.** Well-documented transformations prevent silent schema drift and guarantee lineage back to original datasets.
    
- **Zero-surprise deployment.** A fully-specified service design (IaC paths, security controls, SLOs) lets DevSecOps deploy with one click and auditors trace every control.
    
- **Policy alignment upfront.** Encryption, access roles, and change-approval paths are embedded now—avoiding late-stage security rewrites.
    

---

### **Key Milestones**

1. **Feature Spec Sheet** complete: every engineered variable tagged with classification, missingness, validation test, owner.
    
2. **Transformation Pipeline Doc** published: Mermaid diagram + step-by-step table with IaC paths, encryption, data-quality assertions.
    
3. **Backend Service Design** document approved by Product, Security, CTO, DevSecOps (canvas ID **Template 3**).

### **Primary Roles**

- **Data Scientist / Feature Engineer** – create Feature Spec & tests.
    
- **DevSecOps Engineer** – author IaC, autoscaling, observability.
    
- **Backend/API Engineer** – endpoint definitions & contract alignment.
    
- **Security Officer** – verify encryption, separation-of-duties, WAF rules.
    
- **Project Manager** – trace artefacts to Jira, schedule CCB review.
    

---

### **Policy Coverage**

- **SDLC:** “Design System Components” fulfilled via Feature Spec + Service Design.
    
- **Change-Mgmt:** Each IaC module and script has a Jira ticket; CCB sign-off captured in Backend Service Design section 7.
    
- **Data Classification:** Feature Spec inherits levels; pipeline table documents any downgrades (with de-identification notes).
    

---

### **Outputs / Templates Completed**

1. **3.1 Feature Spec Sheet** – one row per engineered feature.
    
2. **3.2 Transformation Pipeline Doc** – diagram + detailed step table.
    
3. **3.3 Backend Service Design** – full AWS architecture, endpoint & security spec (live in canvas).
    

---

### **Gate Criteria for Phase Exit**

✔ CTO + Security Officer approve Backend Service Design (section 7 sign-off).  
✔ All Feature Spec rows have validation tests & pass data-quality checks.  
✔ Pipeline Doc lists encryption & SoD verifications for every step.

### **Next Step**

Proceed to **Phase 4 – Modeling & App Build**, where we:

- Run reproducible model experiments (MLflow / SageMaker).
- Execute Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist.
- Build mobile app binaries with unit tests & static scanning.
    

**Templates to deliver:* 

- **4.1 Experiment Design & Log**

- **4.2 Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist**
    
- **4.3 Mobile Build & Unit-Test Report**
