| **Enforce policies & close documentation gaps** (0:00–6:57)     | _Phase 0 Charter (0.1) ↢ Security & Privacy Risk Assessment (0.3)_ makes policies mandatory; every phase now has named templates with sign-off columns. **GitHub docs:** Backend Architecture template (3.3) requires architecture diagrams to live in-repo. | 1 pager "Doc Ownership Matrix" (who owns each README) could be added. Automated MkDocs or Docusaurus site generation from repos. |
| **AI workflow standardization** (7:02–11:10)                    | Full 10-phase template suite with Feature Spec, Experiment Log, Validation, Model Card, etc.                                                                                                                                                       | Nothing major—ensure Ferdinando/Igor walk through Phase-3–5 templates in onboarding.                                            |
| **Tool redundancy / ClickUp test-run** (11:11–17:26)            | Methodology is tool-agnostic (templates are Markdown/Sheets).                                                                                                                                                                                      | Need migration playbook: “Jira → ClickUp field-mapping” and CI hooks; could be appended to Change-Log automation.               |
| **Stalled workflows & board hygiene** (17:26–25:58)             | Change-Log (8.2) + Runbook freeze flags prevent hidden “UAT” limbo; PIR (8.1) forces review after 30 days.                                                                                                                                         | Add a _“Work-Item Status Definition”_ appendix to keep ClickUp statuses aligned with lifecycle phases.                          |
| **No more ‘hacks’ / code quality discipline** (21:11–25:58)     | Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist (4.2) + PR metrics table in Mobile Build Report demand proof before merge.                                                                                                                                  | Embed “metric screenshot” CI step so PR cannot merge without checklist JSON attached.                                           |
| **Dimitri off-boarding & knowledge transfer** (25:59–34:00)     | Decommission Checklist (9.2) includes hand-over of artefacts; Change-Log (8.2) captures ownership shift.                                                                                                                                                | Engineer Handover Template (9.3) added to Phase 9 with contact list and repo map details.                                    |
| **QA automation urgency** (34:01–40:00)                         | Integration Test Matrix (5.2) + Mobile Build Report require automated suites; Incident Playbook (7.2) assumes alert-driven QA.                                                                                                                     | Provide a starter Appium/Newman repo and hook build badges into Dashboard Spec (7.1).                                           |
| **PR reviews must include validation evidence** (40:01–47:00)   | Secure-Coding Checklist (4.2) and Validation Checklist (5.1) are both referenced in PR description fields.                                                                                                                                         | Enforce via GitHub Action that blocks merge if checklist YAML missing.                                                          |
| **Leadership / benchmarking & external evaluation** (47:01–end) | Phase-0 Governance gate demands CEO/CTO charter—sets tone for external audits; Model Card (5.3) satisfies transparency.                                                                                                                                  | Schedule **annual external audit** task tied to PIR (8.1).                                                                      |
