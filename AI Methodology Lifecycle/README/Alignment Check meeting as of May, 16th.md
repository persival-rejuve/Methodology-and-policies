### Alignment Check — Meeting-Minutes vs. Lifecycle Methodology

| **Problem / Decision Raised in the Meeting**                    | **Where the New Methodology Already Covers It**                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Gaps / Additional Work Needed**                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enforce policies & close documentation gaps** (0:00–6:57)     | _Phase 0 Charter ⇢ Security & Privacy Risk Assessment_ makes policies mandatory; every phase now has named templates with sign-off columns. **GitHub docs:** Feature/Service Design template (3.3) requires architecture diagrams to live in-repo. | 1 pager “Doc Ownership Matrix” (who owns each README) could be added.  <br>Automated MkDocs or Docusaurus site generation from repos. |
| **AI workflow standardization** (7:02–11:10)                    | Full 10-phase template suite with Feature Spec, Experiment Log, Validation, Model Card, etc.                                                                                                                                                       | Nothing major—ensure Ferdinando/Igor walk through Phase-3–5 templates in onboarding.                                                  |
| **Tool redundancy / ClickUp test-run** (11:11–17:26)            | Methodology is tool-agnostic (templates are Markdown/Sheets).                                                                                                                                                                                      | Need migration playbook: “Jira → ClickUp field-mapping” and CI hooks; could be appended to Change-Log automation.                     |
| **Stalled workflows & board hygiene** (17:26–25:58)             | Change-Log (8.2) + Runbook freeze flags prevent hidden “UAT” limbo; PIR (8.1) forces review after 30 days.                                                                                                                                         | Add a _“Work-Item Status Definition”_ appendix to keep ClickUp statuses aligned with lifecycle phases.                                |
| **No more ‘hacks’ / code quality discipline** (21:11–25:58)     | Secure-Coding & Threat-Model Checklist (4.2) + PR metrics table in Mobile Build Report demand proof before merge.                                                                                                                                  | Embed “metric screenshot” CI step so PR cannot merge without checklist JSON attached.                                                 |
| **Dimitri off-boarding & knowledge transfer** (25:59–34:00)     | Decommission Checklist (9.1) includes hand-over of artefacts; Change-Log captures ownership shift.                                                                                                                                                 | Add a light **“Engineer Handover Template”** (contact list, repo map) to Phase 3 or Phase 9.                                          |
| **QA automation urgency** (34:01–40:00)                         | Integration Test Matrix (5.2) + Mobile Build Report require automated suites; Incident Playbook (7.2) assumes alert-driven QA.                                                                                                                     | Provide a starter Appium/Newman repo and hook build badges into Dashboard Spec (7.1).                                                 |
| **PR reviews must include validation evidence** (40:01–47:00)   | Secure-Coding Checklist (4.2) and Validation Checklist (5.1) are both referenced in PR description fields.                                                                                                                                         | Enforce via GitHub Action that blocks merge if checklist YAML missing.                                                                |
| **Leadership / benchmarking & external evaluation** (47:01–end) | Phase-0 Governance gate demands CEO/CTO charter—sets tone for external audits; Model Card satisfies transparency.                                                                                                                                  | Schedule **annual external audit** task tied to PIR (8.1).                                                                            |

#### Key Take-Aways

- **90 % of the pain points** called out by Jasmine & Persival are now directly mapped to a template or gate in the lifecycle.
    
- **Remaining gaps** are _operational glue_ (tool migration scripts, automated enforcement hooks, and a lightweight hand-over doc).
    
- By filling those small gaps—and training the team to treat each template as “definition of done” inside ClickUp—the company will satisfy the strategic goals of policy enforcement, reduced technical debt, and transparent engineering culture.
